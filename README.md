CocoaBots Xcode Templates
=========================
These are templates to be used with [Apple's Xcode Tools](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html). They provide some basic templates we use to build our apps.

Installation
------------
Install these templates by moving the contents of the checked out folder to:

`~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/`

Be careful not to overwrite any existing templates or plug-ins you may have installed.

Usage
-----
The templates will appear under a new category when creating new files called "*CocoaBots*" - just select any of the templates under that category and create your file as you usually would.
